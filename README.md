# Python 101

This presentation is intended for absolute beginners. The ultimate goal is for the audience to come away with:

- understanding of what Python is and it's context within web development (frontend vs backend; python vs ruby vs php)
- Data types in Python - Strings, Numbers, etc
- Data structures in Python - Lists and Dictionaries
- building your own server using the Flask framework

## Agenda

The workshop should take about 1 to 1.5 hours in total:

```
15 mins - Intros and Icebreaker
10 mins - Part 1 - Bird's eye view
15 minutes - Part 2 - Data types and data structures in Python
30 minutes - Part 3: using Flask to build a web server
```

### Icebreaker

Option A - Quirks
- Everyone goes around the room and answers the following:
- What is a quirk about them?
- Where are they from?
- Why are they here?

Option B - Ball Game
- Everyone cirles up
- First person has a ball, says their name then tosses the ball to someone else. That person then says thank you "name", then say their name and repeat until everyone has said their name and touched the ball.
- redo in same order
- redo without thank you and just names
- redo with no names and cut time in half
- redo cut time in half again and aim to get under 6 seconds for group of 20

### Notes for Presenter

- When presenting, press 's' on the keyboard to show speaker notes (for questions, asides, etc).

- Make sure to show how to use each tool when going over the tool section (especially the console).

- Get to the breakouts as fast as possible, and constantly bring up the console and sublime to showcase concepts. Students learn best when they're the ones typing or seeing live coding, and not just listening to us lecture.

- add ?print-pdf to print slides to PDF. (e.g. index.html?print-pdf#/)
